You need to find help soon, or you'll die an icy death in this desolate place. The air feels crisper here, almost as if the air is anticipating the sharp rap of a hunter's rifle. You hear the eerie sound of wolves howling in the distance. You look around and see that someone made a nice hunting blind here, which stands stoutly against the elements. There is a leanto behind the blind, which looks much worse off. The little structure appears to be straining under the weight of the snow. To the north, you can see a crash site. To the east, there are woods. To the west, the trees give way to some dense brush ladened with snow.",
 "short_description": "Standing in a camp, there still remains a sturdy hunting blind and a leanto. You hear the faint howl of wolves in the distance, coming from where the trees open to some dense brush. To the east there are woods, and to the north is a crash site. There is dense brush to the west.",

It looks dry inside.  Which could be good news for storing items, but at the same time might also have inhabitants that are not all too pleased with your presence."
