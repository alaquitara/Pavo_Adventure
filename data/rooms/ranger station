 "long_description": "You open a creaking door and enter the ranger station. The ranger station is perched between two arms of the rapids. There is a short path outside that leads to a bridge, which crosses over the rapids. The bridge is ruined and not passable. Inside the ranger station, you feel safe and start to relax. The inside of the ranger station is cozy. There is a small scattering of furniture, and the rafters have a few cobwebs that have long since been abandoned by their creators. You see a footlocker that looks interesting. You also see a shortwave radio sitting on a desk. The lights of the shortwave radio are glowing gently, and the speaker crackles slightly. To the west are the rapids. Although the river continues further to the east, you see more severe rapids in that direction and surely you would not be able to navigate them in your canoe.",

Silence... nothing comes back... your heart sinks, you know you heard someone.  Suddenly the speaker on the radio jumps to attention and pushes our a welcome sound 'This is the Fort C F Smith Park Ranger server, we read you <playername>. The bridge is out, how did you make it to the station?  Nevermind, doesn't matter we are sending help and will be there in a few hours.  Hang tight.  Stay on the radio and let us know if your situation changes. Your body relaxes, you sit down in the chair and all the tension releases from your tendons.  Your muscles relax, your pack is suddenly very heavy.  You have barely enough strength to drop it on the floor, everything seems to slow down.  Your eyes close and you fall asleep knowing that finally you will find your way home.  Congratulations you have survived and will be rescued soon from your Desolate Journey!",
