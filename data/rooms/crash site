As you enter the clearing, the breeze stops. You hear the faint sound of wolves howling in the distance, and your pulse quickens. As you look around, you see the remnants of an old dog sled, which appears to have been badly damaged in some sort of accident. You also see a campfire pit. Perhaps the musher who crashed spent some time here tending to injuries or waiting for rescue. To the west, you see the shore. To the east, you notice that the snow has been packed down. You don't see any human footprints, so you assume it is a game trail. To the south, you see a camp with what appears to be a small leanto.",
