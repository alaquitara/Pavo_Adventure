There are a few spots in the ground where you think deer may have searched for grass. The pines get a bit denser and the woods get a bit darker here.  Animals must feel safe here, but it may also bring predators.  Just ahead, you notice some blood stains in the snow.  Towards the south you the trails starts to climb up, the trees thin just a bit and you can see a large rock face with the entrance to dark cave staring back at you ominously.  One of the pines here is curiously bent almost as if creating a marker.  Through the woods to the west is the crash site.",

You see a small blood spot in the snow and one of the pine trees is curiously bent.
