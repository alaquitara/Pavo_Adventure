 "long_description": "You enter into serious rapids. The river is roaring; you can barely manage to keep control of your canoe here! You see a large heron, which is perched on a log that is jammed between several rocks. You also see a large rock shelf just ahead, which you definitely need to paddle around. You are fairly confident that if you dropped something on the rock shelf, it would be lost forever. To the north is the gently flowing river that you left behind. Given the ferocity of the rapids, it is impossible to go back there. To the east, the rapids calm down considerably in front of what appears to be a ranger station. Seeing the ranger station is exciting. Perhaps you can get help there, if you make it that far...",
 "short_description": "You are in rapids; the river is roaring around you. There is a heron sitting on a log, and just ahead of you is a rock shelf that you think you best avoid. You do your best not to drop anything because it would be gone forever if you did. To the north is the much calmer river you left behind, but you know you won't be able to get back there given the rapids. To the east you see the ranger station.",
