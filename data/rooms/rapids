To the north is the gently flowing river that you left behind and you really doubt you'll ever be able to get back up the river.  The rapids take a turn to the east and where you see a spot you can make landfall.  Along the river bank ahead is a Ranger Station, if you make it that far.  You see a large heron perched on a log stuck in the water.  Just in ahead of is a large rock shelf that you feel you definitely need to paddle around.  You are fairly confident it you dropped something here it would be lost forever.",
