 "long_description": "Standing on the bank of the river, the water lapping against the rocky shore and moving past you. It sounds like a roar of fast moving water is coming from the south, must be some Rapids.  To the north, behind you are the dense woods, that abruptly where the rocky banks of the river start.  As though it is a garden that has been lovingly tended to.  The river makes a bend here and towards the east you can see a plume of mist rises from the base of a waterfall. Along the bank sits a canoe.  Its flat bottom may not be the greatest at navigating fast moving water, but it is better than swimming.  Next to the canoe is a large camping cooler. Its color has all but faded, but it once must have been a brilliant blue.",
