 "long_description": "You climb up a ladder and enter the fire tower. From inside the tower, there is an amazing look out in every direction. It is no wonder the tower was built here. You think about how far you have come to get here. It has been quite a journey. It seems as if the tower has not been used for a long time. There are a few counters that are bare, but you see a safe under one of them. In the middle of the tower there is also a central pedestal that is empty but seems to be home to something. You recall your guide telling you about Osborne Fire Finders, which rangers use to determine the direction and estimated distance from the tower of a fire. Your only way out is to the south, towards the mountain summit.",
