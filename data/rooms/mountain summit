It is bitterly cold up here, the blustery wind making your clothes flutter loudly.  To your north you make out a fire tower and back to the west is the winding mountain path.  Along the path to the fire tower is a small storage shed.  The fresh air smells good and lifts your spirits.  You feel confident that you will soon find something can help you get out of this area.  You are well above the tree line, the mountain is dusted with snow and ice.  It is a treacherous climb but taking your time you think you can safely keep going.",
