 "long_description": "As you approach the waterfall you feel the moisture in the air as the mist dances around you.  A few crows circle around in the sky, looking for shiny objects. The water cascading down the side of the cliff is picturesque and if you weren't lost this would be an awesome photo opportunity.  Some moss is clinging for dear life to the rocks along the side of the waterfall, doing its best to not be swept away.  The plunge pool is not very deep and it would a great place to swim when the weather is nice.  Over the years the fall has undercut a small gorge into the side of the rock that you think you could go explore.  You won't be climbing the cliffside any time soon, so the only way to leave is back to the river to the west.",
