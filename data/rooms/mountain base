Looking around, you see several clumps of bloody fur strewn about, which adds to your feeling of unease. You also see an old sign. Although it looks like it has not been maintained for years, it lifts your spirits slightly to see something manmade. To the south, you see a mountain path. The path looks cold and foreboding, but you think you can get up it, perhaps with some scrambling. To the north is a field.",
