 "long_description": "You are in a woods. The tall pines feel like they are trying to surround you here. The wind stirs their tops, causing the trees to sway and making their outer bark creak and crack. The upper branches of the pines are heavily ladened with snow, and every so often, you hear a clump hit the ground with a gentle thump. You look around and see a tree stump. It has a citrusy, piney odor that reminds you of home cleaning products. (Or perhaps home cleaning products should remind you of the woods...) You also see a bent pine tree. It is bent at its base and has grown crookedly. It looks unnatural. To the south you can hear water moving. It must be a river. Its sound reminds you of the much more pleasant affair of tubing in the summertime. Up a slight incline to the east is a small crevice that you think is an entrance to a cave. You see a camp through the trees to the west.",
 "short_description": "You are in a woods. The pines stand packed together around you. They sway gently in the wind like passengers on an overcrowded metro.  here is an old, large tree stump that piques your interest and a bent pine that it looks like the top of a cane only upside down. To the south you can hear a river. To the east, up a slight incline, is an entrance to a cave. And, to the west, you see the camp.",

It still wears a small mantle of bark and must have been a handsome tree before it was savagely cut down.  Logging in the region is big business.  It is curious though why there is only one stump and not more.  Perhaps because it was the biggest of them all."
