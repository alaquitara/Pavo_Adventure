Surely these are just figments of your heightened imagination. You walk into a large room. The light from the lantern is not strong enough to light up the ceiling, so you can't make out how high it is, but the room sounds large. You see a large wooden pole in the center of the room. You also see a small shelf that has been carved out of the cave wall. You are a bit disoriented in the cave, but you think that to the north, through the mouth of the cave, is a game trail. Along the west side of the cave is a small crevice that leads to woods. You think you can fit through the crevice.",
