Hopefully it is all just a small part of your heighten imagination.  You walk into a large room, the lantern light is not strong enough to light up the ceiling, so you can't make out how high it is, but it sounds large.  You are a bit disoriented in the cave but you think that to the north is the game trail towards the large mouth of the cave.  Along the side of the room is a small crevice that you think you can fit through out to the woods to the west.  In the center of the room is a large wooden pole.  On the wall your lantern shines on a small shelf that has been carved out.",
