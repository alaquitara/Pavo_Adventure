After being in the snugness of the forest this field is a bit to open for your taste.  There is a large log lying on the ground.  Off in the distance several grey wolves are gathering and staring intently in your direction.  The hair on the back of your neck stands up as your eyes lock and they begin moving closer to you.  To the east is the dense brush and to the south you see the base of a mountain rising up.",
