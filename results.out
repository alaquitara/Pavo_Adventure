TESTING COMMAND: peek
The icy beach rocks and pebbles crunch under your steps, it takes all your
effort not to slip and fall.  The water along the bank is frozen, the ice has
been scalloped by the wind.  There must have been some warm windy days some time
ago, but not today. Along the bank there is some dark driftwood, that appears as
though it has been there a very long time. As you exhale your breath
crystallizes in front of you and the vapor swirls around you, pushed by the
breeze coming off the water.  Facing west, off in the distance, in the middle of
the water you see a snow capped island.  Behind you are some lightly scattered
pines, in a clearing you think you can see what looks like a crash site.
It is morning.
You are a little worn down, very hungry, and frigid.

TESTING COMMAND: go site
As you walk through the beginnings to a larger wooded area you arrive at a small
clearing.  The pines tower above you, holding up the snow as best as they can.
As you enter the clearing the breeze stops, it is very quiet here.  Every step
you take through the snow crunches and sounds like it is loud enough to wake
every living creature.  In the distance you hear some wolves howling.  You can
see the shore off to the west.  In the clearing are the remnants of an old dog
sledding accident.  Whomever had the accident may have spent a few nights here
before being rescued as there is also a stone circle for a campfire.  Opposite
the direction of the shore you notice a bit of snow that has been packed down,
maybe by animals,   you don't see any human footprints.  Thinking about it you
suspect it may be a game trail.  To your south a footpath goes off through the
woods, to what may be a camp you think you can make out a small leanto.

and to the south is a camp.

TESTING COMMAND: go east
Snow is packed down in multiple directions from the wandering animals in the
area.  They must have heard you coming because you cannot see anything living
around.  There are a few spots in the ground where you think deer may have
searched for grass. The pines get a bit denser and the woods get a bit darker
here.  Animals must feel safe here, but it may also bring predators.  Just
ahead, you notice some blood stains in the snow.  Towards the south you the
trails starts to climb up, the trees thin just a bit and you can see a large
rock face with the entrance to dark cave staring back at you ominously.  One of
the pines here is curiously bent almost as if creating a marker.  Through the
woods to the west is the crash site.

TESTING COMMAND: look rapids
Snow is packed down in multiple directions from the wandering animals in the
area.  They must have heard you coming because you cannot see anything living
around.  There are a few spots in the ground where you think deer may have
searched for grass. The pines get a bit denser and the woods get a bit darker
here.  Animals must feel safe here, but it may also bring predators.  Just
ahead, you notice some blood stains in the snow.  Towards the south you the
trails starts to climb up, the trees thin just a bit and you can see a large
rock face with the entrance to dark cave staring back at you ominously.  One of
the pines here is curiously bent almost as if creating a marker.  Through the
woods to the west is the crash site.
Sadly, Test Player died as a result of extreme wounds, hunger and cold. As hard
as you tried you did not manage to brave the elements. Next time perhaps take
better care of yourself.  Cold, hunger, and illness can along come quickly in
the Desolate Journey. The challenges are tough but they can be overcome and you
will one day find your way to rescue.  But, not on this day.

TESTING COMMAND: site
As you walk through the beginnings to a larger wooded area you arrive at a small
clearing.  The pines tower above you, holding up the snow as best as they can.
As you enter the clearing the breeze stops, it is very quiet here.  Every step
you take through the snow crunches and sounds like it is loud enough to wake
every living creature.  In the distance you hear some wolves howling.  You can
see the shore off to the west.  In the clearing are the remnants of an old dog
sledding accident.  Whomever had the accident may have spent a few nights here
before being rescued as there is also a stone circle for a campfire.  Opposite
the direction of the shore you notice a bit of snow that has been packed down,
maybe by animals,   you don't see any human footprints.  Thinking about it you
suspect it may be a game trail.  To your south a footpath goes off through the
woods, to what may be a camp you think you can make out a small leanto.
It is afternoon.
You are a little worn down, mildly peckish, and chilly.

You stand along the frozen lake bank.  Facing west, out in the middle of the

TESTING COMMAND: east
Snow is packed down in multiple directions from the wandering animals in the
area.  They must have heard you coming because you cannot see anything living
around.  There are a few spots in the ground where you think deer may have
searched for grass. The pines get a bit denser and the woods get a bit darker
here.  Animals must feel safe here, but it may also bring predators.  Just
ahead, you notice some blood stains in the snow.  Towards the south you the
trails starts to climb up, the trees thin just a bit and you can see a large
rock face with the entrance to dark cave staring back at you ominously.  One of
the pines here is curiously bent almost as if creating a marker.  Through the
woods to the west is the crash site.
It is morning.
You are a little worn down, mildly peckish, and frigid.
